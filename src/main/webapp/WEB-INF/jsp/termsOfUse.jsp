</br>
a. By entering the clearly marked payable Member only services , You authorize us to make a charge, or transfer related to your billing method, of the posted rate, as well as any taxes that may apply. Credit card users and certain debit card users will be charged for the first full minute upon entering this area. This nominal amount is automatically refunded to You in the form of a credit to Your Account once You purchase any premium services. For billing inquiries, or to request a detailed statement of Your usage, You may email support@livesexhouse.com
</br>
We charge NO fees for, free live guest chat rooms, profiles, and all other free Members-only services. If access to pay live video chat rooms requires an additional fee, the amount of any such fee is prominently disclosed prior to entering the pay chat room. Paid chat room fees are solely at the discretion and control of the performer and will be fully disclosed to You before You enter any paid chat room. No charge or transfer will be made to Your credit card or related to Your alternative payment method without Your authorization by accessing the Pay Per Minute areas on Your Membership account or authorizing a premium Membership. A premium Membership is a Membership that enables You to access services beyond per minute chat or free Members-only services, such as video or Club Membership. The amount and possible recurrence of all premium Membership fees will be clearly disclosed to You.
</br>
You may also choose to add an additional amount of money by use of "Tokens." Token is a site currency that You can send to a performer in addition to a performer's per minute chat rate, watch certain video from the gallery or all . One Token equals ten units in the currency for which You are charged. The amount of Tokens given will be added to any streaming charges incurred and billed in the same manner. Adding Tokens is completely voluntary and is not required.
</br>
There is no fee for basic Membership of our website.
</br>
Some alternative billing methods do not involve this nominal credit card authorization. In some situations, if You decide to enter a fee-based or premium area of the site, however, You must then upgrade to a full membership. At that time, we may apply a similar nominal charge not to exceed five dollars ($10.00 USD). This nominal amount is automatically refunded to You in the form of a credit to Your livesexhouse.com account, and is credited toward the cost of any premium services You purchase.

</br>
If You are paying dollar-based fees in a currency other than U.S. dollars, Your bank or financial institution may impose fees for currency exchange and for international transactions. For example, Visa and MasterCard typically charge a 1% processing fee on international transactions and most card-issuing banks add their own small additional fees, generally a percentage of Your overall purchase price. Similar considerations apply when there is a difference between the currency in which fees are quoted on the website and the currency in which You make Your actual payment. In some situations, we might be able to change your billing currency. To inquire about this, contact support@livesexhouse.com.
</br>
If you pay for the Service using PayPal, due to the increased cost to us, then an additional charge of 7% of the purchase amount will be added to your bill.
